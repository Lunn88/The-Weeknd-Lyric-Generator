[Verse 1: The Weeknd]And I know she'll be the death of meAt least we'll both be numbAnd she'll always get the best of meThe worst is yet to comeAll the misery was necessary when we're deep in loveThis I know (This I know), yeah, girl, I know[Chorus]'Cause now I'm dancin' in the darkGot a spot down on fifth streetDrinkin' whiskey at the bar, got some random guy with meAnd he doesn't know my name, but he thinks that I'm prettyOh, I swear, I'm never gonna drink again[Verse 2: Halsey]Got a girl with California eyesAnd I thought that she could really be the one this timeBut I never got the chance to make her mineBecause she fell in love with little thin white linesLondon girl with an attitudeWe never told no one, but we look so cuteBoth got way better things to doBut I always think about it when I'm riding through[Bridge: The Weeknd]She told me, "Don't worry about it"She told me, "Don't worry no more"We both know we can't go without itShe told me, "You'll never be alone", oh, oh[Chorus]'Cause now I'm dancin' in the darkGot a spot down on fifth streetDrinkin' whiskey at the bar, got some random guy with meAnd he doesn't know my name, but he thinks that I'm prettyOh, I swear, I'm never gonna drink again[Outro]I always wanna run outside back doorAnd shut down the cityKissing strangers on the backWakin' up with some hickiesTook like four too many shots, hope the hangover kills meOh, I swear, I'm never gonna drink again
