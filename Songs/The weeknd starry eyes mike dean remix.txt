[Verse]I only met you in my dreams beforeWhen I was young and alone in the worldYou were there when I needed someoneTo call my girlAnd now you're my realityAnd I wanna feel you closeBut you're defeated, babyBroken, hurtin', sufferin' from a shattered soulOh, woah, a shattered soulOh, oh-oh[Chorus]Let me be thereLet me be there for your heartLet me be thеreI can be therе 'til you're wholeYou weren't touched by a man in so long'Cause the last time, it was way too strongLet me be thereLet me be there for your heartLet me love youLet me love you like you needAnd I'll make itMake it my responsibilityI'll be there every step of the way, uhI'll get you back on your feetLet me love youLet me love you like you needAnd you can kick meKick me to the curbIt's okay, babyI promise that I felt worseBack then, I was starry eyedAnd now I'm so cynicalBaby, break meKick me to the curbOh, woahMm-mm
