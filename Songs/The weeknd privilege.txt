[Verse]Enjoy your privileged life'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the nightWe said our last goodbyesSo, let's just try to end it with a smile[Pre-Chorus]And I don't wanna hear that you are sufferingYou are suffering no more'Cause I held you down when you were sufferingYou were suffering[Chorus]Blues away, way, wayI got two red pills to take the blues awayBlues away, way, wayI got two red pills to take the blues away[Bridge]And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okayThey said our love is just a game, I don't care what they sayBut I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old waysAnd I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh[Outro]I don't wanna hear that no more, no moreNo more, no moreI don't wanna hear that no more
