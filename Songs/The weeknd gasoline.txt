[Verse 1]It's 5 AM my time againI've soakin' up the moon, can't sleepIt's 5 AM my time againI'm calling and you know it's meI'm pushin' myself furtherI'm just tryin' to feel my heartbeat beat (Beat)I wrap my hands around your neckYou love it when I always squeezeIt's 5 AM, I'm high againAnd you can see that I'm in pain (Ooh, ooh)I've fallen into emptinessI want you 'cause we're both insaneI'm staring into the abyssI'm lookin' at myself againI'm dozing off to R.E.M.I'm trying not to lose my faith[Chorus]And I love it when you watch me sleepYou spin me 'round so I can breatheIt's only safe for you and meI know you won't let me ODAnd if I finally die in peaceJust wrap my body in these sheets (Sheets)And pour out the gasolinеIt don't mean much to me[Verse 2]It's 5 AM, I'm nihilistI know therе's nothing after this (After this)Obsessing over aftermathsApocalypse and hopelessness (Hopelessness)The only thing I understandIs zero sum of tenderness (Tenderness)Oh, baby, please, just hold me closeMake me believe there's more to live[Bridge]Around, around, around, around we goIn this game called life, we are not free[Chorus]And I love it when you watch me sleepYou spin me 'round so I can breatheIt's only safe for you and me (Don't let me go)I know you won't let me OD (Don't you let me go)And if I finally die in peace (Oh yeah)Just wrap my body in these sheetsAnd pour out the gasolineIt don't mean much to me
