Lyrics from snippetGirl, it's okay, you can call me by my real nameI kiss your legs, I kiss your eyes, I call you "Angel face"And I've been single for half a decadeAnd I think I'm finally ready to settle down for like a bitUntil I hit the stageAnd you got money, that's the last thing running through your mindWe always joke, but you can tell when you look me in my eyesThat I want you, that I want you, that I want you, babeThat I want you, that I want you, that I want you, babeCome to my city, I like to say, I'm living pretty nice4000 square feet at the Trump above the city lightsI got no furniture, I just moved here, but we can throw it downEviction number six from the Ritz, girl, I lost count of time
