Take off my disguiseI'm living someone else's lifeSuppressing who I was insideSo I throw 2,000 ones in the skyTogether we're alone (Together we're alone)In Vegas I feel so at home (In Vegas I feel so at home)I'm falling only for the nightSo I throw 2,000 ones in the sky (The sky)How much to light up my star againAnd rewire all my thoughts?Oh baby, won't you remind me what I am?And break, break my little cold heartCall me up and I'll send for youTake me down to your altitudeI don't know if I can bе alone againI don't know if I can sleep alone againCheck my pulsе for a second timeI took too much, I don't wanna dieI don't know if I can be alone againI don't know if I can sleep alone againCount it up, it's all for you, count it upCount it up, it's all for you, count it upI don't know if I can be alone againI don't know if I can be alone again
