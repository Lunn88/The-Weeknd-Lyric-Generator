[Verse 1]We're goin' back in timeI'd like to see you tryUnpackin' thoughts through tunnels in your mindI'll fix you mushroom teaAnd cross the restless seaRelease yourself to escape reality[Pre-Chorus]It doesn't faze youI need a breakthroughI only want what's right in front of meIt's quite unusualSeekin' approvalBeggin' for it desperatelyI said[Chorus]How do I make you love me?How do I make you fall for me?How do I make you want meAnd make it last eternally?How do I make you love me? (Ooh, ah)How do I make you fall for me?How do I make you want me (Ooh, ah)And make it last eternally?[Verse 2]I can see the real you, girlYou don't have to hideForget 'bout what your daddy saidI'll teach you how to shineAnd all the things you toleratedMade you cold insideBut I can light you up againLike embers of a fire[Pre-Chorus]It doesn't faze youI need a breakthroughI only want what's right in front of meIt's quite unusualSeekin' approvalBeggin' for it desperatelyI said[Chorus]How do I make you love me? (Make you love me)How do I make you fall for me? (How do I make you fall?)How do I make you want meAnd make it last eternally?How do I make you love me? (Ooh, ah)How do I make you fall for me?How do I make you want me (Ooh, ah)And make it last eternally?
