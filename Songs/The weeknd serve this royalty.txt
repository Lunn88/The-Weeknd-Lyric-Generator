[Verse 1]All a kid needs is a girl with a dreamA girl like you, with no insecuritiesDon't be ashamed if you all about the gameThat’s what I'm tryna fuck, that's what I’m tryna chaseI like it when you take this money, girl, money, girl, it's all for youJust tryna see you out that shirtI brought money to throw for you, lets go[Verse 2]All a nigga needs is some good ass weedAnd the bass real loud 'til my eardrums bleedAnd if I give you a task, you'll do what I sayAnd you'll do what I say with a smile on your faceAnd you'll serve this royaltyBelieving in me, know, you gotta serve this royalty rightAnd trust what I'm saying, we can get it[Open Verse]
