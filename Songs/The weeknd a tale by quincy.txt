[Spoken: Quincy Jones]That's itLooking back now, I didn't know what it was supposed to beAnd it's like raising kids, manIf you weren't raised, you don't know how to raise, you know?I just did the best that I could with them becauseThey know fuckin' well I love themBut I didn't do the best I couldI didn't know what the fuck I was doingI didn'tI will never forget watching my mother get put in a straightjacketAnd taken out of my home when I was only seven years oldShe was diagnosed with Dementia praecox and put in a mental institutionLeaving my daddy alone with me and my little brother LloydI latеr had an evil stepmother who furthеr cemented the idea that I didn't need a motherGrowing up without one had long lasting influence I didn't fully understand until much later in lifeIt bled into my relationships with family and those I had become romantically involved withWhenever I got too close to a woman, I would cut her offPart of that was vindictive and partially based on fearBut it was also totally subconsciousLooking back is a bitch, isn't it?
