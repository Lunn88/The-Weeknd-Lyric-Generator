[Intro]The wind in the skyPlease gather the cloudsAnd close the way of the windI need to make the beautiful dancerLike a muse, so I can keep looking at herToo bad if you forget about meI have to live with itWe swear by God we will be together foreverNow I'm worried God will take your soulBecause you broke your promiseLike the fire which guards light up to search thingsBurns up in the nightAnd fades into the daylightJust as my love and thoughts of youBurn in the night and fade into the sun[Verse 1]I know you want your money, girl'Cause you do this every day, okayThe way you doubt your feelingsAnd look the other wayWell, it's something I relate toYour gift of nonchalanceBut nobody's ever made me fall in loveWith this amount of touch, well[Pre-Chorus]I'm not a foolI just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless tooBut you taught me how to feelWhen nobody ever wouldAnd you taught me how to loveWhen nobody ever could[Chorus]Ooh girl, I know I should leave youAnd learn to mistreat you'Cause you belong to the worldAnd ooh girl, I wanna embrace youDomesticate youBut you belong to the worldYou belong to the world[Verse 2]And I know that I'm saying too muchEven though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeahAnd I'll pull you closer holding on toEvery moment 'til my time is done, yeahAnd this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smileIn so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby[Pre-Chorus]I'm not a fool (I'm not a fool)I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)I'm not a fool, (Oh no) I'm just lifeless too (I'm just lifeless too)But you taught me how to feel (You taught me how to feel)When nobody ever would (When nobody ever would)And you taught me how to love (You taught me how to love)When nobody ever could (Oh babe, oh babe)[Chorus]Ooh girl, I know I should leave you (I know I should leave you)And learn to mistreat you (And learn to mistreat you)'Cause you belong to the world (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you (Oh babe, I wanna embrace you)Domesticate you (Domesticate you)But you belong to the world (Oh baby)[Bridge]You belong to the world, you belong to the worldYou belong to the loneliness of filling every needOh no, you belong to the world, you belong to the worldYou belong to the temporary moments of a dream[Chorus]Ooh girl, I know I should leave youAnd learn to mistreat you'Cause you belong to the world, ooh yeahAnd ooh girl, I want to embrace youDomesticate youBut you belong to the world[Outro]You belong to the worldYou belong to the worldYou belong to the worldYou belong to the world
