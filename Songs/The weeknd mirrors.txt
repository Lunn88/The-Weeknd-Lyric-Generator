[Verse 1]Bad intentions you bringNo religion that you followStill you bullshit for boys in loveYou're so blind to see that enough is enoughI don't concern myself too muchI'll awake when my time is arrivedWhen all is said and doneTonight wellI can't feel my heartCause you leach off to many heartsWell it's safe to sayThat I've had enough of troubled thoughts in my mindI should try to pray for my demise, ohhh-ohh[Hook]What's the point of wasting love on you?Your indecisive choices lead you hereI walk with a dead and frozen heartDecide to restrain from attaining scarsNeither of us admit to our faultsWhich led to our fall[Verse 2]Tell me what you see in this mirror that you're lookin', babyYou're so ashamed, I see it in the look in your eyesYou're afraid, I wanna show you what's inside of youLet me enter your brain nowPardon me, I only see your reflection, but youBest believe this is a fuckin' test ofWhat you do, oh you know what you doI'ma let you solve your own cluesBaby the hardest part is the will to come inI know you lost respect for meSay that you didCould you give me one last kissSo I could learn to feel againMake me regret everything that I've doneAnd love again, love again[Hook]What's the point of wasting love on you?Your indecisive choices lead you hereI walk with a dead and frozen heartDecide to restrain from attaining scarsNeither of us admit to our faultsWhich led to our fall[Outro]Why don't you run away, run away from himAnd come running to me when you're on your kneesCause I will give the right solutionI can do is love you one last timeJust to recollect memories in our mindWhen everything is done don't act like you know me so wellI'll just be someone that you used to know
