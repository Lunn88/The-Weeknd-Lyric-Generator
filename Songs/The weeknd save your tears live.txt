[Intro]Los AngelesOh, yeah, oh, yeah, talk to me[Verse 1]I saw you dancing in a crowded roomYou look so happy when I'm not with youBut then you saw me, caught you by surpriseA single teardrop falling from your eye, so I say[Refrain]I don't know why I run awayI make you cry when I run away, oh[Verse 2]You could've asked me why I broke your heartYou could've told me that you fell apartBut you walked past me like I wasn't thereAnd just pretended like you didn't care, no, no[Refrain]I don't know why I run away, sing itI make you cry when I run away[Pre-Chorus]Take me back 'cause I wanna staySave your tears for another[Chorus]Savе your tears for another day (Sing it)Save your tеars for another day (One time, right side, I said)Save your tears for another day (Left side, I said)Save your tears for another day (Now it's my turn)Save your tears for another day (I said, save your tears for another day)Save your tears for another day (I said, save your tears)Save your tears for another daySave your tears for another day[Outro]Hey, it's meI know it's been a whileBut I was just thinking about youAnd I'm sorry about everythingI miss you
