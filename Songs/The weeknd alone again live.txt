[Verse]Take off my disguiseI'm living someone else's lifeSuppressing who I was insideSo I throw two thousand ones in the skyTogether, we're aloneIn Los Angeles, I feel so at homeI'm falling only for the nightSo I throw two thousand ones in the skyWell, how much to light up my star again?And rewire my thoughtsOh, baby, won't you remind me what I amAnd break, break my little cold heart?[Refrain]Oh-woahOoh-woah, oh-woahOoh-woah, oh-woahOh, oh[Instrumental Outro]
