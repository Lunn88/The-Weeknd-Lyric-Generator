[Spoken: Jim Carrey]You're tuned to Dawn FMThe middle of nowhere on your dialSo sit back and unpackYou may be here a whileNow that all future plans have been postponedAnd it's time to look back on the things you thought you ownedDo you remember them well?Were you high or just stoned?And how many grudges did you take to your grave?When you weren't liked or followed, how did you behave?Was it often a dissonant chord you were strumming?Were you ever in tune with the song life was humming?If pain's living on when your body's long goneAnd your phantom regret hasn't let it go yetYou may not have died in the way that you mustAll specters are haunted by their own lack of trustWhen you're all out of time, there's nothing but spaceNo hunting, no gathering, no nations, no raceAnd Heaven is closer than those tears on your faceWhen the purple rain falls, we're all bathed in its graceHeaven's for those who let go of regretAnd you have to wait here when you're not all there yetBut you could be there by the end of this songWhere The Weeknd's so good and he plays all week longBang a gong, get it onAnd if your broken heart's heavy when you step on the scaleYou'll be lighter than air when they pull back the veilConsider the flowers, they don't try to look rightThey just open their petals and turn to the lightAre you listening real close? Heaven's not that, it's thisIt's the depth of this moment, we don't reach for blissGod knows life is chaos, but He made one thing trueYou gotta unwind your mind, train your soul to alignAnd dance 'til you find that divine boogalooIn other wordsYou gotta be Heaven to see HeavenMay peace be with you
