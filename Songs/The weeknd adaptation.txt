[Intro]When the sun comes up, you're searching for a loveSo your heart won't lead you to anyoneWhen the sun goes down, I know what you becomeYou become awake, unlike the rest of us[Sample]The afternoon has gently passed me byThe evening spreads its sail against the skyWaiting for tomorrowJust another dayAs I bid yesterday goodbye[Verse 1]I lay my head on a thousand bedsIt's been a test to see how far a manCan go without himselfI think I lost the only piece that held it all in placeNow my madness is the only love I let myself embraceI could've stayed[Chorus]But I chose the lieI chose the lifeThen I realizedShe might have been the oneI let it goFor a little funI made a tradeGave away our daysFor a little fameNow I'll never see your faceBut it's okay I adapted anyway[Verse 2]Adapted to these modelsWho's adapted to the bottleThey take it down like waterJust to burn away their sorrowsI'll stay up â€˜til tomorrowJust to tear down all their moralsAnd all is fair in Love and WarShe's pure[Bridge]So pure, like the love that's so uncut and rawAnd clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered[Chorus]Because I chose the lieI chose the lifeThen I realizedShe might have been the oneI let it goFor a little funI made a tradeGave away our daysFor a little fameNow I'll never see your faceBut it's okay I adapted anyway[Bridge 2]She might just be the oneShe might just be the oneShe might just be the oneShe might just be the one[Sample]The afternoon has gently passed me byThe evening spreads its sail against the skyWaiting for tomorrowJust another dayGod bid yesterday goodbye[Outro]
