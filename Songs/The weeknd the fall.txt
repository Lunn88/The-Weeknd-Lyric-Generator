[Verse 1]You been picking my voice to dance toYou say my money no good in hereEven though I didn't ask youAnd it's the most you've workedEven though I probably don't deserve this girlBut you been dreaming for this moment so you have toBaby, it's OKI got show money, babyI wanna show you how I blow money, babyI wanna show you how I throw money, babyI'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, babyCause I'm a star, don't get it twistedGot some trappers in my carWhat kind of caps I got the brownest of them allSomebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all[Hook]Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I needAnd the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feelAnd it feels so goodIt feels so goodIt feels so goodIt feels so goodI ain't scared of the fallI ain't scared of the fallI ain't scared of the fallI ain't scared of the fallI've felt the ground beforeI've felt the ground beforeI've felt the ground beforeI've felt the ground beforeCuz I ain't scared of the fall[Verse 2]Mama, I understand why you're madAnd it hurts to accept what I amAnd how I liveAnd what I doBut I've been good since ThursdayYes I've been good since ThursdaySo you can watch my love vanishIn a girl with no talentBut to make mula vanishCall her friend for my friendAnd friends name's LexusI let my niggas test itHer morals worth a centAnd best believe I already spent itMy blunt full of B.CMy cup full of TexasFlown on that OVO jet, yeah I said itI was born to be recklessWas forced to make recordsSo you ain't gotta ask "Who's next? Who's next?"[Hook]Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I needAnd the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feelAnd it feels so goodIt feels so goodIt feels so goodIt feels so goodI ain't scared of the fallI ain't scared of the fallI ain't scared of the fallI've felt the ground beforeI've felt the ground beforeI've felt the ground before[Bridge]The fallAnd I ain't scared of the fall[Humming]XOXOXOXOXO
