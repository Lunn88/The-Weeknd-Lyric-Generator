[Verse 1]I used to pray when I was sixteenIf I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleedNot to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreamsWhole squad mobbin' even though we only six deepI was singing notes while my niggas played with six keysWalking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freezeI was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like GillespieNiggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streetsYou couldn't find me like I'm HoffaCover girls jumping out the page like they pop upsSpending all my money on these niggas that I brought upTaking care of families for my brothers when they locked upAnd I had nothing to believe inDouble cup leanin'Couldn't even breathe andFor that money I was fiendingCali was the mission but now a nigga leaving[Chorus]Leaving, leaving into the nightNow a nigga leaving, leavingLeaving into the night, oh[Verse 2]She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceshipFuturistic sex, give her Philip K dickShe never need a man, she what a man needSo I keep on falling for her dailyWe was at Coachella going brazyStack a couple M's like I was ShadyNow I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-ZRockin' Sorayama like he pay meI just signed a new deal with MercedesGot me movin' dirty like I'm SwayzeAll my diamonds dancing like they SwayzeAll my diamonds hitting like they Swae LeeJet so big got a business and a coachAlways livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, niggaAnd for that money, I been fiendingCali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving[Chorus]Leaving, leaving into the nightNow a nigga leaving, leavingLeaving into the night, oh[Bridge]Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in itZero edge pool, never dipped in itSuperstar neighbor in my businessPaparazzi tryna catch me slippin' andGoing on tour is my vacationEvery month another accusationOnly thing I'm phobic of is failingI was never blessed with any patience[Chorus]So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the nightNow a nigga leaving, leavingLeaving into the night, oh
