See this in 3
D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, dont let me drown
I know You wont
Yeah, walkin on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin, brainstormin, normally I cant sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If Ima be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I aint have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now Im the one everyone call on cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin to call, I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah
Oh-oh, I know You wont I know You wont
I know You wont Oh, oh Oh, yeah

So we silently sleep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldnt tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but Im that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, Im goin in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin too lit
Here I go actin too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin after two kids
Its a lot to digest when your life always movin
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, its a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, whos the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin for some true love, ask Kim, What do you love?
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I dont judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple
I see you in 3
D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know Youre watchin me
Eighty degrees, burnin up the leaves
Finally, Im free, finally, Im free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water
Wont you shine Your light? Demons talk on my shoulder
Father, hold me close, dont let me drown
I know You wont 
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life youre living, in this game, oh yeah
Said, said nothing will ever be ever be the same, when youre finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, oh yeah
Uh, I had a good girl in my room, no tats on her skin
I put work all in her purse, she got guilt all in her grin
And I swear it be the same, every fuckin where that I been
All you girls try to be saints, I’ll make you roll with a sinner
You can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend
You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French
Paper planes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin
Dont know what city Im in, wake up and do it again
And if you know me well, you know I dont like to talk
But when I make a move, you know its loud as fuck
And if you wanna scream, get loud as fuck, baby

I recognize your fragrance, hol up, you aint never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dеdicated to you when
Youre in thе mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty
Of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and yall curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, dont approach her with that Atari, nigga, that aint good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs less I write it down for real, P S Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

Looking back now, I didnt know what it was supposed to be
And its like raising kids, man
If you werent raised, you dont know how to raise, you know?
I just did the best that I could with them because
They know fuckin well I love them
But I didnt do the best I could
I didnt know what the fuck I was doing I didnt
I will never forget watching my mother get put in a straightjacket
And taken out of my home when I was only seven years old
She was diagnosed with Dementia praecox and put in a mental institution
Leaving my daddy alone with me and my little brother Lloyd
I latеr had an evil stepmother who furthеr cemented the idea that I didnt need a mother
Growing up without one had long lasting influence I didnt fully understand until much later in life
It bled into my relationships with family and those I had become romantically involved with
Whenever I got too close to a woman, I would cut her off
Part of that was vindictive and partially based on fear
But it was also totally subconscious
Looking back is a bitch, isnt it? 
Baby, youre no good
Cause they warned me bout your type, girl, Ive been ducking left and right
Baby, youre no good
Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you
You got me puttin time in, time in
Nobody got me feelin this way
You probably think Im lyin, lyin
Im used to bitches comin right way
You got me touchin on your body
You got me touchin on your body
To say that were in love is dangerous
But girl, Im so glad were acquainted, oh
Ill get you touchin on your body
Ill get you touchin on your body
I know Id rather be complacent
But girl, Im so glad were acquainted Were acquainted
Baby, youre no good
All my niggas think Im crazy cause Im thinkin bout us lately
But really if I could
Id forget about you, get about you, get about you
You got me puttin time in, time in
Nobody got me feelin this way
You probably think Im lyin, lyin
Im used to bitches comin right way
You got me touchin on your body
You got me touchin on your body
To say that were in love is dangerous
But girl, Im so glad were acquainted, oh
I got you touchin on your body
I got you touchin on your body
I know Id rather be complacent
But girl, Im so glad were acquainted Were acquainted
Momma called me cryin, cryin, cryin, cryin
Cause I wont find somebody thats real She wants somebody thats real, yeah
Cause every time I try to, try to, try to run
The fast life keeps gaining on me The fast life keeps gaining on me, sh-yeah
But ever since I met you Ever since I met you
I couldnt believe what you did
So comfort me, babe, aint no rush from me, babe Woooooh

Cause Im tryna love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink til you numb the pain
I got you touchin on your body
These girls keep touchin on they body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the 90s are dangerous
I got em thinkin that they want me
Although, they know they not the only
I got em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the 90s are dangerous 
When the sun comes up, youre searching for a love
So your heart wont lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye
I lay my head on a thousand beds
Its been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I couldve stayed
But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now Ill never see your face
But its okay I adapted anyway
Adapted to these models
Whos adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
Ill stay up ‘til tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War Shes pure
So pure, like the love thats so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered
Because I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now Ill never see your face
But its okay I adapted anyway
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye  Oh! Ooh, baby
Im fallin in too deep, oh, no
Im fallin in too deep, oh, baby
Im fallin in too deep, oh, lets go!

Take a spliff with the homies while were waiting for a
Couple of women who be down to trip  While trippin off their faces
This molly got us zombie, got me feeling all sedated
White girl loving
With a van full of hippies
Who love us, so lovely
They didnt even hesitate to touch us
They love us, so we lust them
No one will catch them
No one can help them
Two puffs for the lady who be down for that Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And its half-past six
Read skies cause time dont exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and its four feet wide
But its a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag

And no closed doors

Oh the birds are the people who see you and judge you on a daily
They watch you in silence theyll envy all your talents Still you

Youre the total package yet you seek unnecessary attention
And you indulge yourself deep into your depression
You’re a heart break devil, preaching all the sweet lies
But deep inside I see a lost scared, lonely girl
But indecisiveness led you hear and I cant save you
Girl I cant save you, girl it cant be undone
Don’t listen to me because Ive been lying to you
You believe that I love you but youre simply a fool
I never was a friend so dont you cry so soon
And nobodys on your side, youll be the only one to lose
Dont show them that youre weak or youll make them dine at the
Fountain of tears, tears from your eyes
Theyll smile when youre down to your surprise to your surprise
So please, live up to your reputation
Dont sell your soul for who you werent meant, to be
Youll make them see

Lyrics from Snippet
My heavy heart dont stay
My heavy heart
My heavy heart, my heavy heart ‎
Strike a pose with my kinfolk
Front page of the billboards
Suit and tie and cigar smokes
Macallan shots til it burn throats
We still celebratin Super Bowl
Catalog lookin legendary
Ring froze like its February X
O, thats a mercenary
A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruisin on a yacht, we clear, yeah
Said you wanted your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didnt expect to fall for me once you got this dick
The city dark, city dangerous
Your girlfriends tryna pair you with somebody more famous
But instead you endеd up with someone so basic, facelеss
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
My new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, swear it cures my depressin thoughts
Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that Id never fall
But here we go again Ooh
Here we go again
Lifes a dream
Cause its never what it seems
But youd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again
Would you love me in the bimmer?
Ridin around with no diesel, would you be my mamacita?
If it was ice cold with no heater
No peso, no Visas, no talents, no dreamers
If I wasnt walkin  around with no , and paparazzi wasnt taking them pictures
Would it be me?, Would it be we?
Would it be us? Would we still fuck?
But never come back like a joke from the past tense
Would you love me as an average Joe?
I gotta know, I gotta know, before I ask this
Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We dont know how its gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We dont need the government involved because we like to touch
We dont need no damn religion tellin us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, spendin lawyer fees up
Pen and pad gon save my ass if these feelings freeze up
You gon sign this prenup, you gon sign this prenup
You gon sign this prenup, you gon sign this prenup Ooh
Here we go again
Lifes a dream
Cause its never what it seems
But youd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again
The number one station to free your soul Free your soul Dawn 1035 
Strike a pose with my kinfolk
Front page of the billboards
Suit and tie and cigar smokes
Macallan shots til it burn throats
We still celebratin Super Bowl
Catalog lookin legendary
Ring froze like its February X
O, thats a mercenary
A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruisin on a yacht, we clear, yeah

Cause its never what it seems
But youd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again
Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We dont know how its gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We dont need the government involved because we like to touch
We dont need no damn religion tellin us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, spendin lawyer fees up
Pen and pad gon save my ass if these feelings freeze up
You gon sign this prenup, you gon sign this prenup
You gon sign this prenup, you gon sign this prenup Ooh
Here we go again
Lifes a dream
Cause its never what it seems
But youd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again

We just never act a fool, thats just how we fuckin live it
And when we act a fool, its probably cause we mixed it

Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin told me

Yeah, Im talking bout you, man, get to know me

But I wont give it up
Supermodels, they were all fake
Cause I never humped
And I know you, I know you want to
But Im man enough to say to you Oh
Underneath the lies and the big talk
Ive been waiting for a wife
I never watched porn, never did drugs
Cause Im terrified
And I know you, you cant believe its true
But Im man enough to say to you
Im a virgin Uh
Never got close enough
Cell phone blowin up, but Im waiting
For the right person Uh
You wanna hold hands then sign me up
But just know youre not gonna score
Im a virgin Uh
Never got close enough
Pure as a dove, and Im waiting
For the right person
Never once been touched
The power of God in my loins 
Mhm, everything I did before this doesnt matter
It starts, it starts, it starts, it starts, it starts Yeah
Well be together forever

Lyrics from Snippet
I know it seems
That youre not where youre supposed to be
Ah, uh, huh, but I get you here in my life
Ah, uh, huh  
All alone, she was livin
In a world without an end or beginnin
Baby girl was livin life for the feelin
But I dont mind, I dont mind, oh
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I dont mind, I dont mind
And I know Know
That shes capable of anything, its riveting
But when When
You wake up, shes always gone, gone, gone, oh
In the night, she hears him calling
In the night, shes dancin to relieve the pain
Shell never walk away
I dont think you understand
In the night, when she comes crawlin
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin down her face
Shell never walk away
I dont think you understand
He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time All the time, all the time All the time, oh
It make her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time All the time, all the time All the time
And I know Know
That shes capable of anything, its riveting
But when When
You wake up, shes always gone, gone, gone, oh
In the night, she hears him calling
In the night, shes dancin to relieve the pain
Shell never walk away
I dont think you understand
In the night, when she comes crawlin Yeah
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin down her face Fallin down her face
Shell never walk away
I dont think you understand Oh, baby
I dont think you understand Woo
I dont think you understand Ohh
I dont think you understand
Oh, no, no, no
I dont think you understand Hey
In the night, she hears him calling Yeah
In the night, shes dancin to relieve the pain To relieve the pain
Shell never walk away No-no-no-no-no
I dont think you understand Hey
In the night, when she comes crawlin Ooh
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin down her face Its fallin down her face
Shell never walk away
I dont think you understand 
I dont got a single sober vein in my body
I dont got a single sober vein in my body
Dont apologize, I quite enjoy messy
I see that bottle after bottle got you goin crazy
And doin shows after shows got me so lazy
So ride it out for me, and take it off for me
Its a good vibe, good vibe, good vibe
Dont you ever threaten niggas with a good time
She wanna buy a dream, I said I dont sell it
But she can rent it for a night, I dont mind, open wide
Cause all this fame, I earned it, I might as well use it
Private elevator goin straight to my unit
All my niggas round me, gettin kickback pussy
All my killas round me, all be hiding in Stussy
Cant nobody stop me, used to be homeless
Now that penthouse at the Ritz where my home is
Tour bus like a National Geographic
Bitches runnin wild gettin faded in the bathroom
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece
But now we got it
Man look at the kid now, can nobody stop me?
I dont got a single sober vein in my body* Wiz laugh*
I got a lotta cash
I dont mind spending it
Do you like the way I flick my tongue or nah?
You can ride my face until youre drippin cum
Can you lick the tip then throat the dick or nah?
Can you let me stretch that pussy out or nah?
Im not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrapping round me is a prob
Aint nobody tryna save ya
Baby, get that paper
Probably got a lot of other bitches owe you favors
Pussy so good, had to save that shit for later
Took her to the kitchen, fucked her right there on the table
She repping X
O to the death
Im tryna make these bitches sweat
Im tryna keep that pussy wet
Im tryna fuck her and her friends
You gonna run it for these hunnids, girl, or nah?
Show me, is you really bout your money, girl, or nah?
Dont play with a boss, girl, take it all
Take it for a real one, you gon get it all
Is you really bout your money or nah?
Can you really take dick or nah?

Would you ride for a nigga or nah?

Oh, yeah, got you drinking out them white cups, sodas
All this shit so foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby, get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low
My eyes red but my brim low, that X O
She climbing, straight to the top, forgetting why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down you dont wanna die tonight
I promise, when you’re finished, we’ll head to where I’m living
The party won’t finish, it’s a fucking celebration, oh yeah
For my niggas out tonight
And they high off Shakespeare lines
Theres enough to pass around, you dont gotta wait in line
And the clocks dont work, you dont gotta check the time
And the blinds dont work, you dont gotta check the sky
Well be going all night, til light
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
Theres just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
And youve been going hard, baby
Now you rolling with some big boys, baby
Got a lot you wanna show off, baby
Close that door before you take your fucking clothes off, baby
Dont mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and Im experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave cause Ive been zoning for a week
And I aint left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you dancing
Grab a cup of that X
O, baby, I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl, Ive been fiending
For another round, dont you blame it on me
When youre grinding up your teeth and its fucking hard to sleep
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
Theres just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and
Ride it out, ride it out
Work that back til I tire out
Roll that weed, bring that fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Bed so wet when I eat you out
Girls friends scream that Im creeping out
If theyre not down, better keep em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking reefer now
Bet a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out Baby, baby
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby, you can have it all
Theres just something that I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Come over here and ride it out
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

Not your momma, not your sister, not your daddy
Just keep it on that X O Yeah-ah-ah
Nobody has to know, has to know, has to know, oh 
Lyrics from Snippet
Im Addyd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with  Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace

I cant remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my lifes been
I went from starin at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I cant keep up with lovin
And I cant stand talkin to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, Im high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderalls
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I dont care about you, why you worried bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
Im still drippin down from my nose
And I dont know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I dont got any friends, I got X
O in my bloodwork
And Im posted up down in Florida, 
Ft Lauderdale to that M I A
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the V I

Everybody round me is smoking superfantastic
I can make your girl disappear like magic
All I gotta do is follow where the bass is
Smoke a little weed really nothin too drastic
Smoking at the bus stop
Smoking in the bus still
In the room, in the bathroom
When the Ls up pass it
Aint nobody really doing X O damage
Gotta couple pornstars shootin on the mattress
Listening to House of Balloons like a classic

Bad intentions you bring
No religion that you follow
Still you bullshit for boys in love
Youre so blind to see that enough is enough
I dont concern myself too much
Ill awake when my time is arrived
When all is said and done Tonight well
I cant feel my heart
Cause you leach off to many hearts
Well its safe to say
That Ive had enough of troubled thoughts in my mind
I should try to pray for my demise, ohhh-ohh
Whats the point of wasting love on you?
Your indecisive choices lead you here
I walk with a dead and frozen heart
Decide to restrain from attaining scars
Neither of us admit to our faults
Which led to our fall
Tell me what you see in this mirror that youre lookin, baby
Youre so ashamed, I see it in the look in your eyes
Youre afraid, I wanna show you whats inside of you
Let me enter your brain now
Pardon me, I only see your reflection, but you
Best believe this is a fuckin test of
What you do, oh you know what you do
Ima let you solve your own clues
Baby the hardest part is the will to come in
I know you lost respect for me
Say that you did
Could you give me one last kiss
So I could learn to feel again
Make me regret everything that Ive done
And love again, love again
Whats the point of wasting love on you?
Your indecisive choices lead you here
I walk with a dead and frozen heart
Decide to restrain from attaining scars
Neither of us admit to our faults
Which led to our fall
Why dont you run away, run away from him
And come running to me when youre on your knees
Cause I will give the right solution
I can do is love you one last time
Just to recollect memories in our mind
When everything is done dont act like you know me so well
Ill just be someone that you used to know 
Convinced myself to run around with someone else to forget about you
But I cant hold you responsible for the things I do
I said your name by mistake, played it off like Im just confused
But I was frontin, lyin to myself when I know the truth
Was I missed you
Yes, its true
I shouldve known not to let you go, let you go
Cause I missed you Baby boo
We couldve grown if I held you close, held you close
I hurt myself a hundred times just to feel something in my soul
I kept knocking even though I knew whats behind that door
But then I heard you call my name and it sounded like the sweetest song
You never moved on, you were waiting for me all along
Well, I missed you
Yes, its true
I shouldve known not to let you go, let you go
Well, I missed you Baby boo
We couldve grown if I held you close, held you close
Oh, I missed you
Yes, its true
I shouldve known not to let you go, let you go
Girl, I missed you Baby boo
We couldve grown if I held you close, held you close
Well, I missed you 
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour cest toi quon laissera
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour cest toi quon laissera
Oui jai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Oui jai pleuré mais ce jour-là
Je ne pleurerai pas
Je ne pleurerai pas
I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
Cause Im not as hard as I make it seem to be
And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
Cause aint nobody feels the way that I feel when Im alone
So if I said that I wont call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles
If we just went on Un jour cest toi quon laissera
If we just went on Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles
If we just went on Un jour cest toi quon laissera
Happiness exists when you dont know a thing
So I hope you dont think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby Im a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
Cause aint nobody feels the way that I feel when Im alone
So if I said that I wont call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles
If we just went on Un jour cest toi quon laissera
If we just went on Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles
If we just went on Un jour cest toi quon laissera
If we just went on Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles

My darkest hours
My darkest hours
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didnt wanna wake up less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
Id give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin down, uh
I was running away from facin reality, uh
Wastin all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin money to compensate, compensate
Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin in heaven when Im inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin beside you
Ill never let you down again, again Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
Id give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby

Ill hold you down and not let you go
This time, I wont break your heart, your heart, yeah
I know its all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you To you
Cant hide the truth, Id stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
Cause this house is not a home
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
Ill treat you better than I did before
Ill hold you down and not let you go
This time, I wont break your heart, your heart, no

Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life youre living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be ever be the same, when youre finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah
I had a good girl in my room, no tats on her skin
I put work all in her purse, she got guilt all in her grin
And I swear it be the same, every fuckin where that I been
All you girls try to be saints, I’ll make you roll with a sinner, well
You can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend
You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French
Paper planes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin
Dont know what city Im in, wake up and do it again
And if you know me well, I dont like to talk
But when I make a move, you know its loud as fuck
And if you wanna scream, get loud as fuck baby
I can tell youve earned a bit of deconstruction
A little bit, a little bit, ooh yeah ooh Lord
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life youre living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be ever be the same, when youre finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah
Do you feel like youll come back around?
Does it make you strong?
Do you feel like you can take the planet on? Oh girl
Did I seem to give you a little bit more love?
To your gloomy life, to your empty life
Little life, little lie, oh yea
Do you feel like you got your moneys worth?
Cause if you did this rounds on me
Just promise that youll come back to me
Feed me, baby, feed me, baby
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life youre living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be ever be the same, when youre finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah

Freakier than freaky, when she climax she make pee pee
Step back like a player, turn my cheek she try to reach me
What you in this for? Another sucker for a whore
Never I, tailored by my new young Anna Wintour
Centerfold attraction, sexual compassion
Often memories are faded, these are everlastin
Long eyelashes, palmin her every asset
Often imitated because this life I live is lavish
Bud like a flower, Miamis new Eiffel Tower
Love in the dark to the beat of my heart
She came from the ghetto and now her closet is Neiman
Often the results of the women joinin my team and dreamin
Oooh, the suns risin up
The nights almost up
The nights almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again

Lyrics from snippet
Hey, Ima visit the sky today
Hey, I’ma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just cause they try, doesnt mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us 
Lyrics from Snippet
So just me leave me alone now
Were not in touch no more
You said you loved me but I dont care Hey
That I broke my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he 
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Do you like the way I flick my tongue or nah?
You can ride my face until youre drippin ****
Can you lick the tip then throat the **** or nah?
Can you let me stretch that **** out or nah?
Im not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrapping round me is a prob
Aint nobody tryna save you, baby, get that paper
Probably got a lot of other **** owe you favors**** so good, had to save that **** for later
Took her to the kitchen, **** her right there on the table
She repping X
O to the death
Im tryna make these **** sweat
Im tryna keep that **** wet
Im tryna **** her and her friends
Im tryna, talk to me
You gon’ run it for these hunnids, girl, or nah?
Show me, is you really bout your money, girl, or nah?
Dont play with a boss, girl, take it all
Took her for a real one, you gon get it all
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Or nah, baby
Is you really bout your money or nah?
Can you really take **** or nah?
I wanna know, babe Or nah
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Ooh, yeah, and I wanna know
Would you ride for a ****, or
Would you die for a **** Or nah 
Heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue
I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump
Fingers lettin go of the wheel when I cum
Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum
David Carradine, Ima die when I cum Die when I cum
She just givin head, she dont know what I done
Like Im James Dean, Ima die when Im young Die when Im
Die when Im young Die when Im, die when Im young
Heaven knows that Ive been told
Paid for the life that I chose
If I could, Id trade it all
Trade it for a halo
Yeah, she said that shell pray for me
I said its too late for me
Cause I think its safe to say
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
No ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
Valhallas where all the righteous are led
Mulhollands where all the damned will be kept
Devil on my lap and a cross on my neck
Cro-cross on my neck, cro-cross on my neck
Over forty-five, Ima drift on a bend
Do a buck twenty, Ima fly off the edge
Everybody said it would hurt in the end
Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin
She said that shell pray for me
I said its too late for me
Cause I think its safe to say
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
No ordinary life
This aint ordinary life Woah-oh-oh
This aint ordinary life Woah-oh-oh
This aint ordinary life
Angels all singin in monasteries, yeah
My soul is burning in La Ferraris
Father, sorry, Father, sorry
Halos are given to ordinary lives
No, but this aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
This aint ordinary life
No ordinary life
This aint ordinary life Woah-oh-oh
This aint ordinary life Woah-oh-oh

Soon youll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame

Youre tuned to Dawn F M
The middle of nowhere on your dial
So sit back and unpack
You may be here a while
Now that all future plans have been postponed
And its time to look back on the things you thought you owned
Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?
And how many grudges did you take to your grave?
When you werent liked or followed, how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune with the song life was humming?
If pains living on when your bodys long gone
And your phantom regret hasnt let it go yet
You may not have died in the way that you must
All specters are haunted by their own lack of trust
When youre all out of time, theres nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering, no nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those tears on your face
When the purple rain falls, were all bathed in its grace
Heavens for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here when youre not all there yet
But you could be there by the end of this song
Where The Weeknds so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken hearts heavy when you step on the scale
Youll be lighter than air when they pull back the veil
Consider the flowers, they dont try to look right
They just open their petals and turn to the light
Are you listening real close? Heavens not that, its this
Its the depth of this moment, we dont reach for bliss
God knows life is chaos, but He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind, train your soul to align
And dance til you find that divine boogaloo
In other words
You gotta be Heaven to see Heaven
May peace be with you  Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh
Ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah Ooh-ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh
Oh, yeah-yeah Ooh-ooh
Oh, yeah-yeah Ooh-ooh
I been waiting for you
A little bit of practice

Girl, I know you  sittin  
Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back
Into your arms
Said you fucked another man
Finally, I knew this day would come Whoa, oh-oh
Cause I see fear in your eyes
Youve been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land, youre mine
Its been exactly 365 since Ive seen your face
Ive been livin on the road
And youve been livin all alone at home
Girl, I hope, he made you satisfied kimochi
Well, baby, I wont cry
As long as you know that when I land, youre mine
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
There are certain things that Ive come to understand
Expectations can kill a simple man, simple woman, woah
I try to master the art of that far away love
But only so much can keep a woman warm
Now its times like this that I say to myself
Weve been livin in a cold, cold world, cold world
But at least I have you to rely
Even if for a short time
As long as you know that when I land, youre mine
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he cant make you feel this pretty
No, he wont make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there Breakdown
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he cant make you feel this pretty
No, he wont make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
And he cant make you feel this pretty
No, he wont make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh, when I make it there
Quand une putain de colombe blanche chante sa chanson
Cest tout ce quon entend
Les jours se défilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveau10 ans mon ami, que rien dautre ne compte
Elle nétait quune gamine à ce moment
Souffrant dun cœur brisé, une douleur très profonde
Cest là où je lai aperçue, seule, prête à entamer ses 17 ans 
You bring good to my lonely life, honestly

Feel you gone, gone, you slipped away
Here youll always stay with me
The moments shared, the memories as I dream
I look for you, I reminisce
These empty nights I call out to you, feelin for you
Crazy love comes to an end
Another thought, a picture of you, dreamin of you
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
And Ima fuck the pain away, and I know Ill be okay

Enjoy your privileged life
Cause Im not gonna hold you through the night
We said our last goodbyes
So, lets just try to end it with a smile
And I dont wanna hear that you are suffering
You are suffering no more
Cause I held you down when you were suffering
You were suffering
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away

No more, no more

Its ideal, oh
You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real
Theres so much more the world has to reveal
But you choose to be concealed
So youre somebody now
But whats a somebody in a nobody town?
I dont think you even know it
So youre somebody now
But whats a somebody in a nobody town?
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
Its everywhere you go
And just the thought alone got you trippin
Got you losing your mind
And I dont blame you
Its everything you know
But I own this time, this aint new
Now I decide when were through
I love, you love This love Were professional
I know, you know Were sophisticated At loving Were professional
What does it mean, oh
When your hearts already numb? Youre professional
Wont treat it like its personal
No, cause its just love
It always makes its way back around Its dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
Cause everything youve been through made you stronger
And every day, you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how its sposed to
Depending on somebody elses wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl, I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again, oh yeah
I love, you love This love Were professional
I know, you know Were sophisticated At loving
All of those nights you were up barely holding your own
Girl, youve got it made
Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
Now, youve got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, youve got it made
Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oooh, howd you drain all the soul from your eyes?
Howd you teach, teach yourself how to smile
In a world where your dreams cant be real, no?
Every touch that you sell is a lie
I love, you love This love Were professional
I know, you know Were sophisticated At loving Were professional Were professional  
I got em sweating off a throwaway
Such a throwaway
Got them sweating off a sexy
All day girl, our love hmm
And I dont take you for nothing

Girl you know I can get sexy for you any, anytime

Holding back every little urge that you have for me

The reasons you cant have me, so easy to fix
But I feel like its always something like
Dont you get me, Im the same girl

A girl like you, with no insecurities
Dont be ashamed if you all about the game
That’s what Im tryna fuck, thats what I’m tryna chase
I like it when you take this money, girl, money, girl, its all for you
Just tryna see you out that shirt

All a nigga needs is some good ass weed
And the bass real loud til my eardrums bleed
And if I give you a task, youll do what I say
And youll do what I say with a smile on your face
And youll serve this royalty
Believing in me, know, you gotta serve this royalty right
And trust what Im saying, we can get it  All alone All alone All alone All alone
I got somethin to tell you but dont know how Ima say it
I guess that I can only say one thing
Girl, I been bad again, Girl, I been bad again
Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems come solutions
And I use em
When Im faded I forget

Hope you know what you mean to me Me

Lyrics from Snippet
Regret got shit on what youre feelin now
Mad cause he aint like me
Oh, you mad cause nobody ever did it like me 
And Ima be God, and Ima be God
And Ima be God, and Ima be God And 
Ima be God, and 
Ima be God
And Ima be God, and Ima be God to her
And Ima be God, and Ima be God
And Ima be God, and Ima be God
And Ima be God, and Ima be God
And Ima be God, and Ima be God to her
And Ima be God, and Ima be God
And Ima be God, and Ima be 
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like
I ran out of tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets
Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me, then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like Im chosen
And if you aint my nigga, then your girl single to me
I dont give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever son me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldnt touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when Im never makin money, ah
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street niggas eyes
Every time you see me pullin up in Aventadors
Just know we been grindin on them sidewalks
Sidewalks saved my life
They dont ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They show me all the signs
They dont let me down
But they lead me on
And they dont let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on
Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin off Dyke and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin blue lightnin, tightenin, strapped with A K
Say, say, say O
G one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Aw, Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy Astronomer, anonymous
I line em up, we grind em up, theres nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head Head
Head, head, more head Head
Oh God, bless the dead Yup
Im livin life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
Im the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it aint one
Break everything, Im a hustler, came from
Sidewalks saved my life Sidewalks saved my life
They dont ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life Sidewalks saved my life
They show me all the signs
They dont let me down
But they lead me on
And they dont let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on 
Ask around about her
She dont get emotional
Kill off all her feelings

I used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didnt make it, then Id probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldnt find me like Im Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin
Couldnt even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple Ms like I was Shady
Now Im in Tribeca like Im Jay-Z
Rockin Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin dirty like Im Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin on the road, rockin Louis à la mode, nigga
And for that money, I been fiending
Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh
Twenty mill mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing Im phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience
So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh 
Cants and Dos
Sun rays in my rays
Sweatin to my feet
Sippin on lean
On the beach passin other Bs
Still got my two con, color of Poupon
Baggy jean nigga
Got me raggin like U Conn
And the strippers no fruit, God
All my niggas
Celebrate with grey goose
With my Billy Mays crew
Cus we clean so smoove

Yes Ive been good since Thursday
So you can watch my love vanish
In a girl with no talent
But to make mula vanish
Call her friend for my friend
And friends names Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent
And best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B C
My cup full of Texas
Flown on that O V
O jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you aint gotta ask Whos next? Whos next?
Saying this aint nothing, but its all I need

But the only way youll film me is with a camera, feel me?
Youre nothin but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But Im a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep textin me

This is for the House of Balloons fans in So Fi tonight
Im fucking gone right now Listen, listen
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
And girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Skys getting cold, we flying from the north
We rockin in Los Angeles like a sold out show
A house full of pros that specialize in the hoin
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets

Visit evеry month like Im split life living
Let thе world listen
If a haters caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen

All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work

A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when Im over, only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder Ima drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance

I tell myself that Ill take you for the last time
Ill be over you eventually
Time after time, you seem to brush me off
I understand what we have become
You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine
I was in love with your mystery
Now Ill just take what I can get from you
Im not embarrassed to be what you want me to be
Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I dont pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call youll make when youre all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
You just wanna fill the void now
I can tell that you’ve been yelling at him all night long
And I can hear it in your voice now
He got you smoking extra packs a day
Don’t you worry bout me talking
I know why you’ve been coming
I’ll be quiet, this aint nothing to me
Just wrap your legs around my waist
I won’t stop until you ask me
Don’t you worry about us messing up my sheets
Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I dont pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
And know that I will be a call away
The call youll make when youre all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
You’re gonna hate him
Then you’ll want me
Then you’ll miss him
Then you’ll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
Girl, I know your routine
You’re gonna hate him
Then you’ll want me
Then you’ll miss him
Then you’ll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
Girl, I know your routine
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night 
To my fans
I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have No matter what an artists ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy
Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand I usually dont like to spoon feed my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who told stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same The Rolling Stone video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other represents the underground The girl holding on represents you As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest hence pieces of clothing off at every shot The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground Even though I dont want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist
This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for Ill never make you wait again With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to Trilogy Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint Sincerely
